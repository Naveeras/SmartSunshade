We developed a Smart Sunshade Control System that offers an automated and user-friendly solution for controlling indoor lighting. The system is designed to automatically adjust a sunshade based on real-time measurements of ambient light using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR). The system also includes a manual override function, allowing users to control the sunshade via a potentiometer when desired.
There are 2 files, one is for the actuator unit and the other is for the control unit. 
Control unit has 2 main funactions, potentiometer and LCD display to show target light intensity and openness of our shade. 
Actuator unit takes the value of LDR, sends to conrol via a WiFi through an Access Point, usuing UDP perootcol. Control unit then compares the values of LDR and potentiometer and based on the 3 crriteris of Fast, medium or slow response, sends a signal to actuator to operate the servo motor at a certain angle that opens or closes the shade depending on the ambient light
